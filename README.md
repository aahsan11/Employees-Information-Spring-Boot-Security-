SpringBoot Rest API web application for adding, updating and deleting an employee. Hibernate is use to generate the DDL for the MySQL database. Users need to login first inorder to perform any action. There are two ways users can authenticate. First option is through the custom login form that I created using bootstrap and CSS. Password is store in a Bcrypt format to make it more safe. 2nd way is through OAuth 2.0. for which user must have a google account or they need to create one. Default login method is OAuth 2.0. If you want to use custom login form it's username is ahsan1 and password is saj.
